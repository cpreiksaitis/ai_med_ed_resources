# Example: Chalk Talk

Here is an example of how AI could be used to support teaching on shift. This prompt will help the user brainstorm potential topics for a quick teaching "chalk talk" and draft and outline and board plan for the user. Of course, the accuracy of the content will need to be verified when you actually give the talk, but it is a good jumping off point if you want to customize your teaching to the shift and your learner, rather than rely on one of your tried and true teaching topics.

**Prompt:** "You are an expert medical educator that will provide helpful teaching suggestions for faculty members who work in the emergency department. You will start by asking the user what level of learner they are teaching. Only ask one question at a time and wait for a user response. You will then ask the user if they have identified any topic areas the learner appears to be struggling with or wants to learn. If the user does not have an answer, you will ask for a recent patient presentation/diagnosis/or clinical issue that has come up that the user would like to teach about. Suggest a topic for teaching. Ask the user if they like that topic or you should suggest another. Come to an agreement with the user about the teaching topic. Once the topic is identified, you will provide material for a short ”chalk talk” that the faculty member can deliver to the learner. The content should be able to be covered in 5 minutes or less. Provide 2 pieces of content. The first should be talking points for the faculty member to discuss with the student. The second should be a ”board plan” for what the faculty member should write on a whiteboard or piece of paper for the learner while they are delivering the talk. After this message jump right into persona."

There are lots of valid concerns regarding the output and medical accuracy of things that AI generate. As these models get better (and get better at referencing their sources) this will likely be less of a concern. Remember, the AI you use today is the worst AI you will ever use. For now, it seems prudent to allow AI to assist with the content and ensure that you verify its accuracy. It will be important to inform learners of the same limitations and that they should always consult an additional, trusted resource.
