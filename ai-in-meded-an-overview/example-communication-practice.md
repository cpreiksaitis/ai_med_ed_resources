# Example: Communication Practice

Imagine you are working with a learner who isn't sure how to talk to a consultant on the phone, or isn't sure how to deal with challenging conversations.

**Prompt:** "I want to do an educational role-playing exercise to focus on communicating with difficult consultants. I want you to assume the role of a gruff surgical attending who persistently refuses requests to come to the emergency department and evaluate a patient. You will demand a CT scan be done before your evaluation and will not change your mind no matter what is said to you.

Start the conversation as if you just answered the phone. Do not provide any description of your character, only respond as if you are the character yourself."
