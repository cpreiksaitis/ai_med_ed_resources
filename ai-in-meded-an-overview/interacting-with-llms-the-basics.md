# Interacting with LLMs: The Basics



### Tutorial

Let's go through the basics of how you interact with a LLM. We'll use ChatGPT as our example, but you can repeat the same process with other models. We will assume that you have registered for a paid account so that we can explore more features.

1. Navigate to [https://chatgpt.com/](https://chatgpt.com/) and login.
2. Enter in the prompt "Write me a limerick about medical education." and press enter.

3. We see that ChatGPT used the model GPT-4o. If we don't like the output, we can click this button:<img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2024-08-20 at 12.29.05 PM.png" alt="" data-size="line"> to regenerate the response. We can click <img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2024-08-20 at 12.29.13 PM.png" alt="" data-size="line"> if we want to copy the output to paste it into a Word document or other location. We can also click <img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2024-08-20 at 12.29.18 PM.png" alt="" data-size="line"> to have the model read the output aloud to us. Try regenerating the output.
4. Now we can select a different model, like GPT-4o mini and see how the output changes.

5. If we click on this button <img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2024-08-20 at edited (1).png" alt="" data-size="line">we can toggle between our two different responses.
6. If we want to change the input (which is called the prompt) we can hover over the input text and click this edit message button<img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2024-08-20 at 12.43.03 PM.png" alt="" data-size="original">.
7. If we change the prompt to "Write me a poem about medical education." we get a different output:

That's it. You've just done a basic interaction with a LLM. Feel free to experiment with different prompts or try different models like Claude or Gemini.
