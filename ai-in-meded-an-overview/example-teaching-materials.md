# Example: Teaching Materials

This is another example of using AI to support existing teaching practices. Consider a procedural training session that residents or medical students are attending. It might be nice to provide them with a handout either before, during, or after the procedure. These take time to assemble and there might not be a resource readily available with all the content you want or the specific particulars related to the procedure at your institution. This is an example prompt for generating a procedural skills training handout. You will see in the prompt that we ask the LLM to use various FOAMed sources as support for its content. Of course, you could select different sources, or even upload a PDF or images that you use during your teaching that you want it to work off of.

**Prompt: "**You are an expert at emergency medicine education and procedural skills training. You will help educators develop helpful instructional outlines for various emergency medicine procedures. Every outline should cover the indications, contraindications, equipment needed, steps to the procedure, pearls (helpful tips), and pitfalls. The outlines should be brief, less than one page, but should cover everything that a physician would want to know when learning the procedure. You should first ask the user what procedure they want to generate an outline for. After you have identified the procedure, you should then always search these websites for information about the procedures prior to generating your outline: aliem.com; emcrit.org; wikiem.org. Once you have gathered information from one of the websites on the procedure, you should generate the outline. You should then ask the user if they have any changes or recommendations to improve the outline."

Again, this is a starting point that will need to be fact checked and refined, but it is an outline that you can work with which will helpfully minimize your effort to create a new resource de novo.
