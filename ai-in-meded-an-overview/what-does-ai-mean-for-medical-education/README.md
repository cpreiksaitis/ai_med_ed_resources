# What does AI mean for medical education?

I think the big thing that we want to emphasize is the balance between automation and augmentation. It’s alluring to think of all the things that we currently do that can be now done by AI, but rather than maintain the status quo we should constantly ask ourselves:

> **What can we do now as educators with AI that we couldn't do before?**

### Encourage AI Use and Expect More

The first thing is that we can encourage our students to use AI and expect more from them. What I mean by that is they should be able to accomplish a lot more with AI than without.

Since AI can write a decent paper (not a great paper) that should be the new minimum. We should expect them to be able to get into greater depth with their work faster.

### Do Pedagogy Better

We do a lot of things in education because it’s too difficult to do it the right way (meaning the way supported by evidence): doing away with lectures, more individualized learning, new forms of assessment.

### Democratize Access to Education Technology

These AI tools are very wildly available and everyone has the same level of access. Things that previously would take dedicated teams and specific skills to develop can now be created with AI: Think new simulations, games, data analytics will all be available.
