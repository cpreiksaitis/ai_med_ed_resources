* **Academic Honesty and Plagiarism:** AI's undetectable nature raises concerns about academic honesty and plagiarism. Educators need to develop clear policies regarding the use of AI in academic work and educate students about responsible and ethical use of these tools. \[ **Demonstration: Show an example of how AI-generated text can be difficult to distinguish from human-written text.**]
* **Bias and Fairness:** AI models are trained on human data and can inherit biases present in those datasets. It's crucial to be aware of potential biases in AI-generated outputs and critically evaluate them before using them in educational settings. \[ **Demonstration: Show an example of how AI-generated text can reflect biases present in the training data.**]
* **Data Privacy and Security:** Sharing sensitive information with AI models raises privacy concerns. It's essential to use reputable and secure AI platforms and avoid inputting any confidential or personally identifiable information.
