# Interacting with LLMs: Prompt Engineering

* **Prompting:** LLMs like ChatGPT interact through prompts, which are instructions or questions you provide to guide the AI's response.
* **Prompt engineering:** Crafting effective prompts is crucial for getting optimal results from LLMs. Consider these principles:
  1. **Context:** Clearly specify the role you want the AI to assume and the context of your request. For example, "Act like an expert in medical education" or "You are a tutor for medical students."
  2. **Specific Instructions:** Provide detailed instructions to guide the AI towards the desired output. Be explicit about the type of response you need (paragraph, list, table, etc.), the tone (academic, conversational), and any specific requirements.
  3. **Examples:** Include examples to illustrate the desired output format or style. This helps the AI understand your expectations better.
* **Iterative Refinement:** The output of LLMs can vary. Experiment with different prompts, provide feedback, and iteratively refine your instructions until you achieve satisfactory results.

### Tutorial

Let's go through the basics of prompt engineering. We'll use ChatGPT as our example, but you can repeat the same process with other models. We will assume that you have registered for a paid account so that we can explore more features.

1. Navigate to [https://chatgpt.com/](https://chatgpt.com/) and login.
2. Enter in the prompt "Write me a paragraph about simulation." and press enter.
